# ReactJS
## Components
Reusable pieces of React code to control part of the user interface. Components capture the strructure of UI, and can have internal data to track the user behavior throughout the lifetime of the app.
## State
Dynamic data in a React component. This is often used to track variables that will be re-rendered in the UI based on events that occur in the application. <br />
**React State Rule: Never Directly Modify State. Instead use the `this.setState` method.**
## Props
Data in a React component that gets passed down from its parent. In the parent component, it will pass data down to the child component through attributes in the child component's JSX.
## 3 core pillars
HTML, CSS y JS are the core pillars of web dev. ReactJS exists in the JS layer of a web application.
## The client-server architecture
Web apps are documents served to browsers. The client-server describes the relationship between a client requesting the document for a web app (html, css, js) from a server computer that can respond with them.
## Blunding
React projects are bundled and transpiled. Blunding is the process of taking many JS files and combining them into one giant JS file for the HTML to refer to. This is useful because the browser doesn't natively support the import/export system that is used in React projects. <br />
Parcel blunder is a tool that achieves bundling.
## Transpiling
Is the process of translating modern JS code in a syntax that the browser actually supports. This is neccesary because as the JS language envolves and adds new features, the browser must keep up and support those additions. Therefore, the feature set that the browser can support will always be a bit behind the overall JS language.<br />
Babel is a toll that achives transpilation.
## DOM
React optimized DOM calls with the Virtual DOM.
